<h1>SHA256</h1>

SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and first published in 2001. They are built using the Merkle–Damgård construction, from a one-way compression function itself built using the Davies–Meyer structure from a specialized block cipher.

This implementation is for getting 256-bit hash.

<h2>Usage:</2>

To use it you must copy files from src and create object SHA256.

<h2>Compile:</h2>

1. Go to tmp
2. Run:

```bash
cmake ./
make
```

3. And now you have test.out file in tmp
